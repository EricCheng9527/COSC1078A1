    <h3>Personal Information</h3>

    Hi, my name is Haizhou Cheng, you also can call me Eric.
Student number: s3622097
Email Address: 81996862gmail.com
I come from China, Shenzhen which is the first economic zone in China. Because I am Chinese so my first language is Chinese, I am doing undergraduate about Information Technology in RMIT. This is my first time learning knowledge in university and also this is my first time learning something by use English. I am a person with wide range interest, I like sport, I can swim, play basketball, table tennis, billiard and so on. Even though I am not really good at it but still enjoy it. Also I really love card, I play all the things contain card, for example poke card game and poke card trick, magic gathering game, Hearthstone. Next of course is video game. My favourite game is league of legend, second favourite is blizzard抯 game.

Interest in IT
For me, IT is a very powerful things. Because I have read a lot of article and book, also watch some video about IT, all of this material are talking about IT equal future. Along with the human being抯 technology improve. IT industry will be more important than before. And also after 5G come out, everything in our life all will connect with each other, that is the reason why I choose IT, because that is the subject which connected with future.
There have 3 different reason cause me choose RMIT. First is because RMIT is locate in Melbourne CBD, this university have almost the best location in Melbourne. The city campus near the Melbourne central train station, so I can come school by use a very easy way. Second reason is because of school facility. As we know, Melbourne University is the best university in Melbourne and maybe is the best in Australian (somebody say is ANU). Of course Melbourne University course抯 rank is higher than RMIT, but you compare school facilities like building and library, I am pretty sure RMIT is better than Melbourne University. (Some Melbourne University抯 student come and study in RMIT library).

During the time I study in RMIT I prefer to learn something which can help me find a good job. Because the knowledge we learn in undergraduate is not enough for the high level research or scientific research. So I plan to learn the useful and basic knowledge in first year study, and then looking for some subject like big data or artificial intelligence which can widen my knowledge and help me decide what should I do in master degree.

    <h3>Idea Job</h3>

My ideal job is data analyst, the reason why I choose this job is because it can use in almost all different area, just like what I am wrote in 慖nterest in IT? after 5G come out every company need to deal with plenty of data, data may become the most thing everyone need to facing in everyday, no matter who you are where you live, you all need to look at different type of data and make a correct decision about how to use it. And also this job can help me learning Artificial Intelligence in the future. Because AI is a kind of predict machine, their mainly job is working with different type of data. And predict the correct future which can help human being. However, this job is not very easy to get. If I want to find this job, I need to learn a lot of things in different area. For example the URL I put at top is a data analyst job抯 advertisement, this job called Graduate AI Engineer ?Data Analyst. This job requires a lot of skills and experience, such as strong Python and JavaScript skill, have experience with AI or machine learning and LAMP + Mongo DB blended stack. Also need some experience about AWS knowledge, and they prefer the person who graduated recently. To be honest, I don抰 really have almost all experience about above requirement skill. The only one I have been touch is the Java Script. If I want to get this job, I need to try my best to learn all the software skill which I wrote above, and also need to find some course about machine learning, big data and AI in year 2 and 3 in RMIT. If it still not enough, then I need to look for a master degree course which contain machine learning or AI skill which can help me improve my knowledge.
